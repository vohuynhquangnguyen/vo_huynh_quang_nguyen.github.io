## Ahoy There!
My name is Vo, Huynh Quang Nguyen, or Lucius for short. I am an engineering and science enthusiast with an industrial background in Computer Vision (CV), Artificial Intelligent (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). 

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. program in Industrial Engineering and Management at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater (OSU). My research interests are primarily data science, computed intelligence, and computational architecture with a focus on machine-vision-based and data-driven solutions to enable the smart manufacturing of semiconductor devices. I am proficient in [Python](https://www.python.org/), statistical analysis with [SAS JMP](https://www.jmp.com/en_us/home.html), data retrieval and processing with [SQL](https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html), and data visualization with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). I also excel in digital image processing with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), ML/DL model development, and deployment with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html#) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). These proficiencies are exemplarily demonstrated by the Data Science projects I have completed as well as the guest lectures I have given at various universities. More details about these projects can be found at my [portfolio](../_pages/portfolio.md). Feel free to check this [page](../_pages/teaching.md) if you are interested in my lectures, tutorials, and workshops.

Moreover, I am a contributor for AI Vietnam since June 2021, which is one of the largest Vietnamese communities of AI enthusiasts. The community was co-lead by Dr. Vinh Dinh Quang (currently tenuring at Vietnamese-German University) and Dr. Phuc Nguyen Hong (currently tenuring at Eastern International University).

I love writing, a lot! Hence, you can find many posts where I share my experiences in how to learn English, how to start coding in several programming languages such as Python, how to prepare a good profile to apply for doctoral studies, as well as my commentaries in this [page](../_pages/year-archive.md).

## My Prior Life!
From April 2021 to December 2022, I worked at Intel Products Vietnam, which is an assembly/test manufacturing site belonging to Intel Corp located in Vietnam. My work at Intel Products Vietnam primarily comprised: (1) the development and deployment of automated inspection solutions for downstream processes; (2) mentoring programming and ML methods for aspiring engineers as an associate of both Intel AI and Intel Image Analytics Centers of Excellence. Additionally, I was a member of Intel NextGen (Vietnam branch), which is an initiative to streamline and enhance the integration experience of new hires.

Before joining Intel Products Vietnam, I had the blessing to join First Solar Vietnam from November 2020 to April 2021 as an engineering trainee to work on a project in commonality analysis for defects generated by laser scribing processes on thin-film solar panels.

Before working at Intel Products Vietnam and First Solar Vietnam, I received my degree of M.Sc with a master <a href = "https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/102461">thesis</a> in ML/DL from Aalto University, Finland in December 2020. At Aalto University, I worked with <a href = "https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/petri-k%C3%A4rh%C3%A4">Dr. Petri Kärhä</a> and <a href = "https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/erkki-ikonen">Prof. Erkki Ikonen</a> on developing a measurement setup to determine the differential spectral responsivity of solar cells. We also worked, albeit for a limited time, on an estimation method to include uncertainties of spectral mismatch in solar cell calibration.

## My Prior prior Life!
Before starting my M.Sc. at Aalto University in Autumn 2018, I went to Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Science, Finland where I did my bachelor's in Electronics. As an undergraduate student, I did some research in wireless sensor networks under Dr. Matti Fisher (currently retired).
