## About Me
I am an engineering and science enthusiast having the core values of agility, responsibility, and teamwork. To fulfil my dream of becoming an influential researcher in my field, I always push myself out of my comfort zone to achieve my goals. During my free time, I devote wholeheartedly to my lifelong passions: liberal arts, and language.

I can offer my solid understanding of Semiconductor Devices, Optical Metrology, Computer Vision, and Data Science thanks to the experiences I accumulated from my work placements and my studies. Besides, I possess an excellent eye for detail, a hard-working and responsible personality, and project management skills. These skills and experience should make me an ideal candidate for positions related to Semiconductor Design and Manufacturing, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning Operations.

* November 2020 - March 2021: Manufacturing Engineer Trainee 
  * First Solar Vietnam, located in Dong Nam Industrial Park, Cu Chi, Vietnam
  * Supervisor: Nguyen, Thanh Hai
  * Responsibilities:
    * Project: Established a standardized electroluminescence image database for fault detection and diagnosis in the laser scribing process for thin-film solar panels. The project was completed successfully, and its results were used as a whitepaper for troubleshooting tasks in laser scribing. Additionally, the process monitoring software - developed during the project - was verified and is currently applied to all of First Solar's factories.
    * Technical Sharing: Organized several technical sharing sessions about laser physics and optics in engineering. These sessions were well applauded by the attendees - “[the team] have found a lot of knowledge useful that [the team] didn't get at college and university”, as quoted by Mr. Tam Huynh (Senior Manufacturing Engineer).
  
* July 2020 - September 2020: Research and Development Associate - Thesis Worker  
  * SolarBK, located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
  * Supervisor: Nguyen, Vinh Khuong
  * Responsibilities:
    * Project (Master Thesis): Developed an AI-based method to evaluate silicon photovoltaic cells' reliability for quality assurance purposes After 30.09.2020, RMIT University Vietnam became the new sponsor of this project. The project was completed successfully, and the corresponding thesis was published in January 2021.
    * Fundraising: Assisted in writing funding applications for two joint-venture projects between SolarBK and their collaborators that were Synergict UK and Arup UK, respectively. These applications were submitted to the Energy Catalyst Round 8, which was a funding competition organized by Innovate UK.

* March 2019 - December 2019: Research Assistant
  * Metrology Research Institute, Aalto University, located in Espoo, Finland
  * Supervisor: Petri Karha
