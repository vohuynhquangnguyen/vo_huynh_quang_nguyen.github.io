**March 15, 2023**: I wrote a post about my experience of applying for a Ph.D. program in the US, which I hoped would serve as either a guide or at least a reference for those preparing for their Ph.D. program application. The post is available to read [here](../_posts/2023-03-14-phd-application.md).

**Dec 26, 2022**: at Intel Corp, there are two most pretigious conferences namely the Intel Manufacturing Excellence Conference (IMEC) and Intel AI Everywhere Conference (IAIEC). For the 2023 AIEC, I submited three projects that I was leading to the conference, and I got all three accepted! This was truly a marvelous achievement not only for my team but also for Intel Vietnam as this was the first time Intel Vietnam participated an AI-related conference within the corporation.
