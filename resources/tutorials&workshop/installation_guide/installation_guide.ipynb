    "1. First, we must understand IDE. So, what is IDE? \n",
    "    * An **integrated development environment** (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). \n",
    "    * An IDE typically consists of:\n",
    "        - **Source code edito**r: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language-specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written.\n",
    "        - **Local build automation**: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.\n",
    "        - **Debugger**: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.\n",
    "    * One of the most common IDE is Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It can be downloaded and installed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "<br></br>\n",

    "2. When searching for information on Python, you usually hear the following phrases: **Python implementation**, **Python distribution**, **Python dependencies** and **Python** itself. So exactly what are these?\n",
    "    * **Python itself**: when referring to Python itself, we only consider the set of rules that are defined in [Python.org](http://python.org/), i.e. the behaviours associated with Python.\n",
    "    * **Python implementation**: when referring to Python implementation, we are considering the actual program (e.g., [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython#:~:text=CPython%20is%20the%20reference%20implementation,Guido%20van%20Rossum)) that provides such behaviours.\n",
    "    * **Python distribution**: when referring to Python distribution, we are considering (1) Python implementations and (2) accompanied tools and libraries.\n",
    "    * **Python dependencies**: when referring to Python dependencies, we are considering all necessary software components that are needed for our work.\n",

    "3. Here, we only concern Python distribution. There are two primary Python distributions:\n",
    "    * Anaconda (a.k.a conda)\n",
    "    * Package Installer for Python (a.k.a pip)\n",
    "\n",
    "| conda | pip |\n",
    "|-------|-----|\n",
    "| Install packages (i.e. libraries) and software that are Python and other languages → no need to install the compiler (since it already comes with the distribution). | Install only packages (i.e. libraries) that are Python $\\rightarrow$ a compiler is needed to be installed first. |\n",
    "| Can create containers, i.e., isolated environments that can contain different versions of Python and/or installed packages. | |\n",
    "| When installing packages, a solver is run to ensure all requirements of all packages installed in an environment are met. | When installing packages, no effort is made to ensure that the dependencies of all packages are fulfilled simultaneously. |\n",
