    "1. First, we must understand IDE. So, what is IDE? \n",
    "    * An **integrated development environment** (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). \n",
    "    * An IDE typically consists of:\n",
    "        - **Source code edito**r: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language-specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written.\n",
    "        - **Local build automation**: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.\n",
    "        - **Debugger**: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.\n",
    "    * One of the most common IDE is Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It can be downloaded and installed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "2. When searching for information on Python, you usually hear the following phrases: **Python implementation**, **Python distribution**, **Python dependencies** and **Python** itself. So exactly what are these?\n",
    "    * **Python itself**: when referring to Python itself, we only consider the set of rules that are defined in [Python.org](http://python.org/), i.e. the behaviours associated with Python.\n",
    "    * **Python implementation**: when referring to Python implementation, we are considering the actual program (e.g., [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython#:~:text=CPython%20is%20the%20reference%20implementation,Guido%20van%20Rossum)) that provides such behaviours.\n",
    "    * **Python distribution**: when referring to Python distribution, we are considering (1) Python implementations and (2) accompanied tools and libraries.\n",
    "    * **Python dependencies**: when referring to Python dependencies, we are considering all necessary software components that are needed for our work.\n",
