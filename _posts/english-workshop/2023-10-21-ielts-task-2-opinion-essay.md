Sau đây là một bài viết mẫu về đề bài trên:

<blockquote>
It is undeniable that voluntary work offers numerous benefits for both individuals and society. However, the idea of mandating teenagers to engage in unpaid work during their leisure time is a contentious one. I strongly disagree with this proposition. In the following essay, I will articulate why this concept is flawed, based on two primary reasons.
<br>
<br>
To commence with, current teenagers have already faced tremendous pressures in many aspects of their life without the added responsibilities of community work. Current schoolwork has become as demanding as a full-time job that requires great focus and commitment from teenagers.  Thus, it is advisable for teenagers to spend time enjoying themselves with their friends and families whenever they have free time. Young people are also more likely to opt for leisure activities to relieve their stresses after finishing their duties. Therefore, community work should be encouraged not enforced on young people.
<br>
<br>
Besides, society would not gain any substantial benefit by obligating young people to conduct unpaid charity work. To delve deeper, the author argues that advocating for compulsory unpaid work goes against the fundamental foundations of modern society which are freedom and fairness. Moreover, forcing young people to do something against their will would reinforce their resentment towards the current society because they feel being abused. In the long run, such a system of compulsory unpaid community work would potentially lead to negative implications. 
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, teenagers are encouraged to choose to work and help others during their free time for free, but this should not make compulsory.

College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field. To what extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
</blockquote>

Tương tự như ở trên, các bạn hãy phân tích đề bài qua việc nhận diện xem chủ đề và yêu cầu là gì:
1. Chủ đề: các bạn sinh viên nên chọn ngành học theo thị trường làm việc.
2. Yêu cầu: người viết phải đưa ra quan điểm cá nhân (đồng ý hay không đồng ý) đồng thời phải đưa ra những luận điểm và luận cứ bảo vệ cho quan điểm của họ.

Sau đây là một bài viết mẫu về đề bài trên. Cá bạn lưu ý rằng trong bài viết này có mục phản Đề (`Give a counterpoint`):

<blockquote>
The choice of selecting which major to enroll in college is never an easy task. Thus, there is a strong notion that colleges students are recommended to pursue fields of study that conforms job market demand. I, however, strongly disagree with this view. I argue that students should base their choice on subjects that closely link with their interest for the following two reasons.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, the job market is ever-changing meaning choosing a major during college based on the availability of works is to opt for a short-term perspective. For instance, during the 1960s and through the 1980s, nuclear engineering was one of the rapidly growing fields because of the Nuclear Weapon Armament Race between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact, as well as the increasing build-up of nuclear power plants. As a result, graduates of nuclear engineering could easily find jobs upon graduation and received many boons. This acted as a feedback loop that incentivizes newer generations to select this field. However, because of several nuclear power plant incidents such as the Chernobyl Crisis and the Fukushima Accident, governments start to ratify laws that decrease the usage of this power. Consequently, those that selected nuclear engineering when it was in high demand now face a very different job market.  The above example illustrates that job market is capricious since it contains an abundant amount of unpredictable elements. Therefore, choosing of a field of study based on its availability of jobs is not a wise move.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, assume that the job market is not dynamic in nature, it is recommended to pursue what interests us the most because it greatly affects how we can be effective at work. Hypothetically speaking, a student who is passionate about art can enroll in data science major as: (1) this is the most popular career in the 2020s; (2) selecting this allows he to land in several lucrative job opportunities. He, however, is likely to run to a field that he abhors and a work that he finds no satisfaction in. Imagine how bored an artistic person would be when he has to work eight-by-five in front of a computer screen. As a result, he would become unmotivated and likely to perform not in his best abilities. Researches have consistently demonstrated that happiness plays a vital role in work efficiency. Thus, workers who find personal satisfaction at their work are the most efficient performers. Hence, this example above demonstrates why it is preferable that colleges students should opt for majors that are closely linked to what they are ardent for.
<br>
<br>
Indisputably, given that attending colleges is considered to be a significant investment, it is justifiable to select on-demand majors because they have a higher return-on-investment value. This materialistic view, nevertheless, would be deleterious because we do not focus on what truly matters: our happiness and subsequently, our mental health. By selecting what we are interested in, we can execute to the best of our ability and can accomplish even better than following with the crowd.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, colleges students are recommended not to base their choice of field on the availability of jobs in that field because the job market is dynamic and there are many benefits to follow their interests.

## Overview
Consider the following example:

<blockquote>
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?* Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
</blockquote>

Let's analysis this example:
1. Prompt: All teenagers <u>should be required to do unpaid work</u> in their free time to help the local community because this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
2. Task: We are asked to give a stand (Strongly disagree - Moderately disagree - Moderately agree - Strongly agree), and provide justifications for our stands.

Here is my proposed structure of a response for this example, which is applicable for this type of question:
* Introduction: `Hook` - `Shift to the prompt` - `Thesis` - `Outline`.
    * Hook: In the ``Hook`` part, we provide a “matter-of-fact” that relates to the prompt.
    * Shift: In the `Shift` part, we mainly paraphrase the prompt.
    * Thesis: In the `Thesis` part, we highlight the main idea of our response $\rightarrow$ in the Agree or Disagree question type, the thesis is our stance on the prompt.
    * Outline: In the `Outline` part, we provides a general outline of the contents in our essay.
* Body: in the Body section, we need to have at least two or three paragraphs:
    * Introduce the first idea - Develop/explain the idea - Give examples - Wrap up the idea.
    * Introduce the second idea - Develop/explain the idea - Give examples - Wrap up the idea.
    * Give a counterpoint $\rightarrow$ this part is optional.
* Conclusion: Restate the thesis $\rightarrow$ again, in the Agree or Disagree question type, the thesis is our stance on the prompt.

Below is a sample response to see how this structure is applied in pratice:

<blockquote>
It is undeniable that voluntary work offers numerous benefits for both individuals and society. However, the idea of mandating teenagers to engage in unpaid work during their leisure time is a contentious one. I strongly disagree with this proposition.

Let's consider another example:

<blockquote>
College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field. To what extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
</blockquote>

Let's analysis this example:
1. Prompt: Students should select their majors according to demands in current labor market.
2. Task: Give a stand (Strongly disagree - Moderately disagree - Moderately agree - Strongly agree), and provide justifications for the stand.

Below is a sample response to see how this structure is applied in pratice. Noted that in this sample response, the `Give a counterpoint` part is included:
