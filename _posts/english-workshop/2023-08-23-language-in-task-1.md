In IELTS Task 1, there are two primary types of language you need to get familiarized with: Language of Change, and Language of Ratio/Percentage.

## Language of Changes
1. Consider the following graph:

Here is the list of expressions we can use to describes trends of these two lines:
* A - B: In this case, we can use `dipped`, which means fell slightly but recovered quickly.
* B - C: Here, we can use either `fell`, `dropped` or `shrank` with complimentary adverbs such as `drastically`, `dramatically`, or `sharply` to describe a sharp reduction. Similar expressions are `plummeted to` or `plunged to`.
* B - D: Here, we can use `dropped and then levelled off`. Another similar expression would be `dropped and then evened out at`.
* D - F: Here, the perfect expressions would be `rose dramatically` or `increased dramatically`. Another common expressions would be `rocketed`.
* F: When the data reach the highest possible value, we usually use these expressions - `hit a peak`, `peaked at`, or `reached a high of`.
* F - H: When the data go up and down multiple times, we will use `fluctuated` or `was erratic`.
* G: When the data reach the lowest possible values, we use these expressions - `hit a low of` or `bottomed out at`.
* I - J: Here, we usually use these expressions `rose steadily` or `increased at a steady pace`.
* J - K: Here, these expressions `remained flat`, `remained constant`, `remained unchanged`, or `stable at` are commonly used.
* L - M: Here, we usually use the `fell gradually` expression.

2. In Academic Writing, we usually use the following structures to describe changes during a particular timeframe.

| Structure | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| There + be + adjective + noun + in + noun | There was a slow rise in the number of kilograms consumed. |
| Noun + verb + adverb | Rice consumption increased steadily. |
| Time + saw/experienced/witnessed + adjective + noun + in + noun | 1999 experienced a gradual increase in rice consumption. |

## Language of Ratio/Percentage
