In IELTS Task 1, there are two primary types of language you need to get familiarized with: Language of Change, and Language of Ratio/Percentage.

## Language of Changes
1. Consider the following graph:

Here is the list of expressions we can use to describes trends of these two lines:
* A - B: In this case, we can use `dipped`, which means fell slightly but recovered quickly.
* B - C: Here, we can use either `fell`, `dropped` or `shrank` with complimentary adverbs such as `drastically`, `dramatically`, or `sharply` to describe a sharp reduction. Similar expressions are `plummeted to` or `plunged to`.
* B - D: Here, we can use `dropped and then levelled off`. Another similar expression would be `dropped and then evened out at`.
* D - F: Here, the perfect expressions would be `rose dramatically` or `increased dramatically`. Another common expressions would be `rocketed`.
* F: When the data reach the highest possible value, we usually use these expressions - `hit a peak`, `peaked at`, or `reached a high of`.
* F - H: When the data go up and down multiple times, we will use `fluctuated` or `was erratic`.
* G: When the data reach the lowest possible values, we use these expressions - `hit a low of` or `bottomed out at`.
* I - J: Here, we usually use these expressions `rose steadily` or `increased at a steady pace`.
* J - K: Here, these expressions `remained flat`, `remained constant`, `remained unchanged`, or `stable at` are commonly used.
* L - M: Here, we usually use the `fell gradually` expression.

2. In Academic Writing, we usually use the following structures to describe changes during a particular timeframe.

| Structure | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| There + be + adjective + noun + in + noun | There was a slow rise in the number of kilograms consumed. |
| Noun + verb + adverb | Rice consumption increased steadily. |
| Time + saw/experienced/witnessed + adjective + noun + in + noun | 1999 experienced a gradual increase in rice consumption. |

3. Here is an example of how the language of changes (expressions of describing changes and corresponding timeframe) is used:

This line chart describes the changes and the overall decline in the 
share price of KBP over a period of four years from 2006 to 2010.

| Year | Trend|
|------|------|
| 2006 | The share price of KBP was **at first** **situated at** $12 <u>at the beginning of 2006</u>. <u>Over the course of 2006</u>, the stock price **experienced several fluctuations** before **drastically rising to** $31 <u>by the end of the year</u>. |
| 2007 | The high price was short-lived, however, as the share price **dropped to** $22 <u>by the end of 2007</u>, despite several **small recoveries** during <u>mid-2007</u>. |
| 2008 | The share price then **quickly rebounded to** $30 by <u>mid-2008</u> before **plummeting to** just over $5 <u>at the end of the year</u>. |
| 2009 | The share price **began to recover** in <u>early 2009</u>, and despite **some fluctuations**, it **continued to rise until** it **reached a peak of** $17 in <u>early 2010</u>. |
| 2010 | The share price eventually **declined to** $11 <u>by the end of the period</u>. |

## Language of Ratio/Percentage
Here are some common expressions that we use when describing a table, a pie chart, or a bar graph with some comparisons included:

| Expression	| Example |
|-------------|---------|
| x times the number of y	| The Iron Maiden concert was attended by three times the number of many people as the Stone Temple Pilots concert. |
|more than x% of y |	More than 40% of people chose to use public transport. |
| the bulk of x	| The bulk of purchases came from China as opposed to the E.U. |
| one in x y | One in four customers ordered digital rather than traditional print products. |
| under x%	| The social media website lost just under 75% of its visitors when compared to last year. |
| the largest proportion of x |	The largest proportion of spending is on food, drinks, and tobacco than any other product categories. |
| x had the lowest percentage	| The expenditure on leisure/education had the lowest percentage. |

## Practice
To write a good response for IELTS Task 1, you need to have a rich lexical resources, especially in how to describe trends and quantities. Hence, here are my proposals on how to enrich your repertoire:
1. Do all exercises in these chapters of the **Check your English vocabulary for IELTS** workbook by Rawdon Wyatt - `Changes 1`, `Changes 2`, `Contrast & Comparison`, `Size, Quantity & Dimension`, and `Time`.
2. Do exercises in chapters that focus on describing tables, pie chars, bar charts, and line charts in the **Collins Get Ready for IELTS Writing** by Fiona Aish and Jo Tomlinson.
