In IELTS Task 1, there are two primary types of language you need to get familiarized with: Language of Change, and Language of Ratio/Percentage.

## Language of Changes
Consider the following graph:

Here is the list of expressions we can use to describes trends of these two lines:
* A - B: In this case, we can use `dipped`, which means fell slightly but recovered quickly.
* B - C: Here, we can use either `fell`, `dropped` or `shrank` with complimentary adverbs such as `drastically`, `dramatically`, or `sharply` to describe a sharp reduction. Similar expressions are `plummeted to` or `plunged to`.
* B - D: Here, we can use `dropped and then levelled off`. Another similar expression would be `dropped and then evened out at`.
* D - F: Here, the perfect expressions would be `rose dramatically` or `increased dramatically`. Another common expressions would be `rocketed`.
F: hit a peak/peaked at/reached a high of …
F-H: fluctuated ~ was erratic.
G: Hit a low of … / bottomed out at
I-J: rose/increased steadily
J-K: remained flat/constant/unchanged/stable at
L-M: fell gradually.

## Language of Ratio/Percentage
