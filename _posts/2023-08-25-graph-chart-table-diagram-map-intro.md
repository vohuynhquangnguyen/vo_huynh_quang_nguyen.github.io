Một câu trả lời điển hình cho Task 1 của phần thi Viết Học Thuật của IELTS (Academic IELTS) bao gồm hai phần chính: Mở Bài (Introduction) và Thân Bài (Body). Trong bài viết này, chúng ta sẽ khám phá cách tạo ra phần Introduction một cách hiệu quả để chuẩn bị cho phần còn lại của câu trả lời của các bạn. Bằng cách tuân theo những hướng dẫn này, các bạn có thể đảm bảo rằng phần Mở Bài của các bạn sẽ trở nên rõ ràng hơn, ngắn gọn hơn, và hấp dẫn hơn. Hãy bắt đầu nào!

(ENG: A typical response for Task 1 of the IELTS Academic Writing Test consists of two primary parts: an Introduction and a Body. In this article, we will explore how to craft a compelling Introduction that effectively sets the stage for the rest of your response. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Introduction is clear, concise, and engaging, capturing the attention of your reader and setting the tone for the rest of your essay. Let’s get started!)

# Cấu trúc của phần Mở Bài (Structure of an introduction)
The introduction to a graph description typically consists of two main parts:
* **Description of the Graph, i.e., What does the graph show?:** This part should provide a brief overview of the graph, including:
  * The type of graph being described, i.e. What type of graph are we describing?
  * The information presented in the graph, i.e., What is the information?
  * The units of measurement used, i.e., How is this information measured?
  * The time period covered by the data (if applicable), i.e., Is there a time period?

* **Overview of the Graph, i.e., What is the overview of this graph?:** This part should provide a high-level summary of the main patterns or trends observed in the graph, such as:
  * The most significant changes or movements.
  * Any notable similarities or differences between data sets.
  * Any other key observations that can be made from the graph.

By including these two elements in your introduction, you can provide your reader with a clear and concise overview of the graph and its key features. Note that no statistical information about the graph (i.e. numbers, percentages, figures, etc.) is mentioned.

# Làm sao để viết phần Mở Bài (How to write the introduction)
1. In the first part of the introduction (**What type of graph are we describing?**), we typically paraphrase the description of the graph provided by the question.
2. In the second part of the introduction (**What is the overview of this graph?**), we provide a high-level summary of the main trends or patterns observed in the graph. To do this effectively, we should:
  * Begin our sentences with appropriate phrases that indicate we are providing an overview, such as ``Overall``, or ``In general``;
  * Highlight the most significant trends or patterns presented in the graph, using clear and concise language.


# Phân tích câu trả lời mẫu (Analyzing sample responses)
Consider the following example:

![The line graph below shows changes in fast food consumed in the UK between 1970 and 1990. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words. Source: Marc Roche.](https://github.com/vohuynhquangnguyen/vohuynhquangnguyen.github.io/blob/main/_posts/posts_images/graph-chart-diagram-map-intro-1.png)

Let's analyze this example:
1. **What type of graph are we describing?**: line graph.
2. **What is the information?**: changes in the consumption of fast foods in three categories (hamburgers, fish & chips, and pizzas) in the UK.
3. **How is this information measured?**: in grams per week (g/w).
4. **Is there a time period?**: for a period of 20 years from 1970 to 1990.

Here are some sample responses to this example:
* Mẫu 1 (Response 1): The graph illustrates shifts in the amount of fast food consumed in the UK between 1970 and 1990. Several trends are apparent. Firstly, the UK population are eating more and more fast food. Secondly, the type of fast food has changed.
* Mẫu 2 (Response 2): The graph shows the amount of fast food eaten between 1970 and 1990 in grams per person per week. Overall, the amount of fast food consumed more than doubled during the period.
* Mẫu 3 - đây là câu trả lời mà mình tự viết (My own response): The line chart describes the changes in the consumption of fast foods in the UK for a period of 20 years from 1970 to 1990. The data are measured in grams per week (g/w) and are broken down into three categories namely hamburgers, fish & chips, and pizzas. Overall, there was an upward trend in the consumption of hamburgers and fish & chips, while the number of pizzas consumed declined over the period.
