This is a collection of my proposed lessons for self-learning English in a structured and effective manner. 

Please note that:
*  This collection is targeted towards learners of Academic English preparing for standardized language proficiency tests such as IELTS. 
* Most of the lessons here are created with the intention of preparing the readers for IELTS. However, even those not preparing for IELTS may find the lessons useful.
* The lessons are written in both English and Vietnamese, making it a great reference for Vietnamese learners struggling with the language.
