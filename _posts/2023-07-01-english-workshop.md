This is my proposed approach for self-studying English in a structured and effective manner. Please note that:
* This approach is targeted towards learners of Academic English preparing for standardized language proficiency tests such as IELTS. 
* Most of the lessons here are created with the intention of preparing the readers for IELTS. However, even those not preparing for IELTS may find the lessons useful.
* The lessons are written in both English and Vietnamese, making it a great reference for Vietnamese learners struggling with the language.

The list of lessons are as follows:
# Writing
## IELTS Academic Writing
1. An overview of the IELTS Academic Writing Test
2. How to get a Band 7.0+ for the IELTS Academic Writing Test
    * Introducing the Graph
    * Language of Changes
    * Describing Bar Charts
    * Describing Pie Charts
    * Describing Tables
    * Describing Process Flows
    * Describing Maps
