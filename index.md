## Ahoy There!
<div style="text-align: justify">
My name is Quang-Nguyen Vo-Huynh, Lucius for short. I am an engineering and science enthusiast with an industrial background in Computer Vision (CV), Artificial Intelligent (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I am currently working at <b>Intel Products Vietnam</b>, which is an assembly/test manufacturing site belonging to <b>Intel Corp</b> located in Vietnam. My work at <b>Intel Products Vietnam</b> comprises: (1) the development and deployment of automated inspection solutions for downstream processes; (2) mentoring programming and ML methods for aspiring engineers as an associate of both Intel AI and Intel Image Analytics Centers of Excellence. Moreover, I am a contributor for <b>AI Vietnam</b>, which is one of the largest Vietnamese communities of AI enthusiasts.

I am looking for opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. program in System Engineering and Computed Intelligence. My research interests are machine-vision-based and data-driven solutions to enable the smart manufacturing of semiconductor devices. I am proficient in Python, statistical analysis with JMP, data retrieval and processing with SQL, and data visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn. Additionally, I excel in digital image processing with OpenCV, ML/DL model development, and deployment with scikit-learn and TensorFlow. These proficiencies are exemplarily demonstrated by the Data Science projects I have completed. More details about these projects can be found at my <a href = "/pages/portfolio">portfolio</a>.

## My Prior Life!
<div style="text-align: justify">
Before joining <b>Intel Products Vietnam</b>, I received my degree of M.Sc with a master <a href = "https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/102461">thesis</a> in ML/DL from Aalto University, Finland in December 2020. At Aalto University, I worked with <a href = "https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/petri-k%C3%A4rh%C3%A4">Dr. Petri Kärhä</a> and <a href = "https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/erkki-ikonen">Prof. Erkki Ikonen</a> on developing a measurement setup to determine the differential spectral responsivity of solar cells. We also worked, albeit for a limited time, on an estimation method to include uncertainties of spectral mismatch in solar cell calibration. From November 2020 to April 2021, I had the blessing to join First Solar Vietnam as an engineering trainee to work on a project in commonality analysis for defects generated by laser scribing processes on thin-film solar panels.

## My Prior prior Life!
<div style="text-align: justify">
Before starting my M.Sc. at Aalto University in Autumn 2018, I went to Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Science, Finland where I did my bachelors in Electronics. As an undergraduate student, I did some research in wireless sensor networks under Dr. Matti Fisher (currently retired).
