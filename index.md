## Ahoy There!
My name is Quang-Nguyen Vo-Huynh, Lucius for short. I am an engineering and science enthusiast with a strong industrial background in Computer Vision (CV), Artificial Intellignent (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I am currently working at **Intel Products Vietnam**, which is an assembly/test manufacturing site belonged to **Intel Corp** located in Vietnam. My works at **Intel Products Vietnam** comprise mostly the development and deployment of automated inspection solutions for downstream processes as well as mentoring programming and ML methods for aspiring engineers as an associate of both Intel AI and Intel Image Analytics Centers of Excellence. Moreover, I am an contributor for **AI Vietnam**, which is one of the largest Vietnamese community of AI enthuasists.

I am pursuing a Ph.D. program in System Engineering at Ira A. Fulton School, Arizona State University, USA. My research interests are machine-vision-based and data-driven solutions to enable smart manufacturing of semiconductor devices. I am proficient in Python, statistical analysis with JMP, data retrieval and processing with SQL, and data visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn. Additionally, I am excel in digital image processing with OpenCV, ML/DL model development and deployment with scikit-learn and TensorFlow. These proficiencies are exemplarily demonstrated by Data Science projects I have completed. More details about these projects can be found at:

## My Prior Life!
Prior joining **Intel Products Vietnam**, I received my degree of M.Sc with a [thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/102461) in Computer Science from Aalto University, Finland in December 2020. At Aalto University, I had an opportunity to work with Dr. Petri Kärhä and Prof. Erkki Ikonen on developing a measurement setup to determine differential spectral responsivity of solar cells. We also worked, albeit for a limited time, on an estimation method to take into consideration uncertainties of spectral mismatch in solar cell calibration. From
