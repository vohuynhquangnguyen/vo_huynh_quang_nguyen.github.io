## Ahoy There!
My name is Quang-Nguyen Vo-Huynh, Lucius for short. I am an engineering and science enthusiast with an industrial background in Computer Vision (CV), Artificial Intelligent (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I am currently working at **Intel Products Vietnam**, which is an assembly/test manufacturing site belonging to **Intel Corp** located in Vietnam. My work at **Intel Products Vietnam** comprises: (1) the development and deployment of automated inspection solutions for downstream processes; (2) mentoring programming and ML methods for aspiring engineers as an associate of both Intel AI and Intel Image Analytics Centers of Excellence. Moreover, I am a contributor for **AI Vietnam**, which is one of the largest Vietnamese communities of AI enthusiasts.

I am pursuing a Ph.D. program in System Engineering at Ira A. Fulton School, Arizona State University, USA. My research interests are machine-vision-based and data-driven solutions to enable the smart manufacturing of semiconductor devices. I am proficient in Python, statistical analysis with JMP, data retrieval and processing with SQL, and data visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn. Additionally, I excel in digital image processing with OpenCV, ML/DL model development, and deployment with scikit-learn and TensorFlow. These proficiencies are exemplarily demonstrated by the Data Science projects I have completed. More details about these projects can be found at my [portfolio](/sample_page).



## My Prior Life!
Before joining **Intel Products Vietnam**, I received my degree of M.Sc with a master [thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/102461) in ML/DL from Aalto University, Finland in December 2020. At Aalto University, I worked with Dr. Petri Kärhä and Prof. Erkki Ikonen on developing a measurement setup to determine the differential spectral responsivity of solar cells. We also worked, albeit for a limited time, on an estimation method to include uncertainties of spectral mismatch in solar cell calibration. From November 2020 to April 2021, I had the blessing to join First Solar Vietnam as an engineering trainee to work on a project in commonality analysis for defects generated by laser scribing processes on thin-film solar panels.

## My Prior prior Life!
Before starting my M.Sc. at Aalto University in Autumn 2018, I went to Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Science, Finland where I did my bachelors in Electronics. As an undergraduate student, I did some research in wireless sensor networks under Dr. Matti Fisher (currently retired).
