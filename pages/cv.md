## ABOUT ME
 I am an engineering and science enthusiast having the core values of agility, responsibility, and teamwork. To fulfill my dream of becoming an influential researcher in my field, I always push myself out of my comfort zone to achieve my goals. During my free time, I devote wholeheartedly to my lifelong passions: liberal arts, and language.

I can offer my solid understanding of Semiconductor Devices, Optical Metrology, Computer Vision, and Data Science thanks to the experiences I accumulated from my work placements and my studies. Besides, I possess an excellent eye for detail, a hard-working and responsible personality, and project management skills. These skills and experience should make me an ideal candidate for positions related to Semiconductor Design and Manufacturing, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning Operations.
