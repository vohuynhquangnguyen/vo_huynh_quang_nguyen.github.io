**Jan 12, 2023**: in Late November 2022, I had been invited by Mr. Khuong Nguyen Vinh, who is currently an Associated Lecturer of RMIT Vietnam, to give a guest lecture about the application of optics or optoelectronics in real life. I presented the lecture in Jan 11, 2023. The lecture slides can be found [here](/resources/lectures/how_to_make_frames_and_infer_people.pptx).

**Dec 26, 2022**: at Intel Corp, there are two most pretigious conferences namely the Intel Manufacturing Excellence Conference (IMEC) and Intel AI Everywhere Conference (IAIEC). For the 2023 AIEC, I submited three projects that I was leading to the conference, and I got all three accepted! This was truly a marvelous achievement not only for my team but also for Intel Vietnam as this was the first time Intel Vietnam participated an AI-related conference within the corporation.
