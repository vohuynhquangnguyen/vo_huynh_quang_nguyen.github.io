Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in data science and machine learning. It is utilized for predicting continuous variables using one or more predictor variables. In this mini-project, I will build a simple linear regression model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.

The implementation of this project is available [here](https://github.com/vohuynhquangnguyen/portfolio.codes-and-bytes/tree/main/projects/linear-regression).
