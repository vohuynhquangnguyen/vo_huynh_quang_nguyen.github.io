This section contains lecture notes as well as solutions to exercises of my self-learning about linear algebra from online courses and textbooks. Here is the disclaimer:
1. Only the topics in linear algebra that is applicable for Machine Learning and Data Science are included in this folder.
2. The contents are based on:
    * The [Linear Algebra course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/home/) offered by deeplearning.ai in Coursera.
    * The [Linear Algebra course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/home/) offered by Imperial College London in Coursera.
    * The two courses [MS-A001 Matrix Algebra](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=36345) and [MS-C1342 Linear Algebra](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=32610) taught at Aalto University, Finland.
    * The two textbooks [Linear Algebra](https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/) by Jim Hefferon and [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong.
