This is a collection of my projects and lecture notes, designed to enhance learning and solidify my understanding of essential probability and statistics concepts crucial for mastering Machine Learning and Data Science. 

The contents of the lecture notes are based on the following courses:
- Probability and Statistics, part of the [Mathematics for Data Science and Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science) offered by Coursera.
- [Introduction to Probability](https://www.edx.org/learn/probability/harvard-university-introduction-to-probability) offered by edX.
- IEM-5013 Probability and Statistics for Engineers offered by Oklahoma State University.
- STATS-5543 Applied Regression Analysis offered by Oklahoma State University.
- IEM-5133 Stochastic Process offered by Oklahoma State University.

# Probability Theory
In this series of lecture notes, I will explain the fundamental concepts of the following topics:
* Overview of probability and counting.
* Condition probability.
* Random variables.
* Joint probability distribution.

For this series of lecture notes, the following textbooks are used to complement this lecture note.
- **Introduction to Probability (2nd Edition)** by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang .
- **Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers (7th Edition)** by Douglas C. Montgomery and George C. Runger.

# Statistical Inference
In this series of lecture notes, I will explain the fundamental concepts of the following topics:
* Confidence interval
* Hypothesis Test
* Non-parametric Test

For this series of lecture notes, the following textbooks are used to complement this lecture note.
- **Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers (7th Edition)** by Douglas C. Montgomery and George C. Runger.
- **Statistics - The Art and Science of Learning (5th Edition)** from Data by Alan Agresti.


# Regression Analysis
For this series of lecture notes and projects, the following textbooks are used to complement this lecture note.
- **Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers (7th Edition)** by Douglas C. Montgomery and George C. Runger.


## Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in data science and machine learning. It is utilized for predicting continuous variables using one or more predictor variables. In this project, I will:
* Explain the fundamental concepts behind linear regression;
* Build a simple linear regression (SLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.
* Build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.

The implementation of this project is available [here](https://github.com/vohuynhquangnguyen/portfolio.codes-and-bytes/tree/main/projects/linear-regression).
