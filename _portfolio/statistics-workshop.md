This is a collection of my projects and notes for learning and reviewing important probability and statistics for the journey of masterning Machine Learning and Data Science. 

# Statistical Inference

## Confidence Interval

## Hypothesis Test


# Regression Analysis
## Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in data science and machine learning. It is utilized for predicting continuous variables using one or more predictor variables. In this project, I will:
* Explain the fundamental concepts behind linear regression;
* Build a simple linear regression (SLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.
* Build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.

The implementation of this project is available [here](https://github.com/vohuynhquangnguyen/portfolio.codes-and-bytes/tree/main/projects/linear-regression).
