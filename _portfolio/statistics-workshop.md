<!-- # Probability Theory
In this series of lecture notes, I will explain the fundamental concepts of the following topics:
* Overview of probability and counting.
* Condition probability.
* Random variables.
* Joint probability distribution.

For this series of lecture notes, the following textbooks are used to complement this lecture note.
- **Introduction to Probability (2nd Edition)** by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang .
- **Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers (7th Edition)** by Douglas C. Montgomery and George C. Runger.

# Statistical Inference
In this series of lecture notes, I will explain the fundamental concepts of the following topics:
* Confidence interval
* Hypothesis Test
* Non-parametric Test

For this series of lecture notes, the following textbooks are used to complement this lecture note.
- **Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers (7th Edition)** by Douglas C. Montgomery and George C. Runger.
- **Statistics - The Art and Science of Learning (5th Edition)** from Data by Alan Agresti.

# Regression Analysis
In this series of lecture notes, I will explain the concepts of the following topics:
* Simple and multiple linear regression models.
* Logistic regression models.

For this series of lecture notes and projects, the following textbooks are used to complement this lecture note.
- **Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis (5th Edition)** by Douglas C. Montgomery, Elizabeth A. Peck, and G. Geoffrey Vining.
- **A Second Course in Statistics: Regression Analysis (8th Edition)** by William Mendenhall, and Terry Sincich. -->


<!-- ## Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in data science and machine learning. It is utilized for predicting continuous variables using one or more predictor variables. 

In [this project](), I will:
* Explain the fundamental concepts behind linear regression;
* Build a simple linear regression (SLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.
* Build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.

In [this project](), I will showcase how a thorough explanatory regression analysis is conducted using a sample dataset. -->

# Applied Statistics
