## Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in data science and machine learning. It is utilized for predicting continuous variables using one or more predictor variables. 

In [this project](), I will:
* Explain the fundamental concepts behind linear regression;
* Build a simple linear regression (SLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.
* Build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model using Python from scratch, and implement functions enabling us to evaluate our model.

In [this project](), I will showcase how a thorough explanatory regression analysis is conducted using a sample dataset.
