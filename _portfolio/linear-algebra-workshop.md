This is a collection of my projects and notes for learning and reviewing important linear algebra for the journey of masterning Machine Learning and Data Science. 

# Methods of Solving a System of Linear Equation
Systems of linear equations are fundamental to a wide array of disciplines - from physics to computer science, from economics to engineering. In this project, I will discuss how we can leverage  the elegance of matrix algebra and optimization to solve a system of linear equations. 

The implementation of this project is available [here](https://github.com/vohuynhquangnguyen/portfolio.codes-and-bytes/tree/main/projects/system-linear-equations).
