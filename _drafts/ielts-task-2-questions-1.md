In this lesson, we will delve into common question types in Task 2 of the IELTS Academic Writing Test. The contents of this lesson are primarily based on these textbooks: **IELTS Writing Masterclass 8.5** by Marc Roche, and **Collins Get Ready for IELTS Writing** by Fiona Aish and Jo Tomlinson. The lesson is written in both English and Vietnamese. Moreover, this lesson is part of my collection of proposed lessons for self-learning English. You can navigate the entire collection [here](/posts/2023/07/english-workshop/).

## Argumentative/Opinion/Agree or Disagree
Consider the following example:

<blockquote>
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?* Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
</blockquote>

Let's analysis this example:
1. Prompt: All teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community because this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
2. Task: We are asked to give a stand (Strongly disagree - Moderately disagree - Moderately agree - Strongly agree), and provide justifications for our stands.
3. Question Type: Agree or Disagree.

Here is my proposed structure of a response for this example, which is applicable for this type of question:
* Introduction: Hook - Shift to the prompt - Thesis - Outline.
* Body: in the Body section, we need to have at least two or three paragraphs:
    * Introduce the first idea - Develop/explain the idea - Give examples - Wrap up the idea.
    * Introduce the second idea - Develop/explain the idea - Give examples - Wrap up the idea.
    * Give a concession.
* Conclusion: Restate the thesis 

Let's analyze the following sample response to see how this structure is applied in pratice:

<blockquote>
Nobody would dispute the fact that young people gain numerous benefits for both individuals and societies as a whole by working on a voluntary basis. The author, however, strongly disagrees with enforcing teenagers to do unpaid work. The essay the author wrote below will discuss why this notion is illogical based on the following two reasons.
<br>
<br>

To commence with, current teenagers have already faced tremendous pressures in many aspects of their life without the added responsibilities of community work. Current schoolwork has become as demanding as a full-time job that requires great focus and commitment from teenagers.  Thus, it is advisable for teenagers to spend time enjoying themselves with their friends and families whenever they have free time. Young people are also more likely to opt for leisure activities to relieve their stresses after finishing their duties. Therefore, community work should be encouraged not enforced on young people.
<br>
<br>
Besides, society would not gain any substantial benefit by obligating young people to conduct unpaid charity work. To delve deeper, the author argues that advocating for compulsory unpaid work goes against the fundamental foundations of modern society which are freedom and fairness. Moreover, forcing young people to do something against their will would reinforce their resentment towards the current society because they feel being abused. In the long run, such a system of compulsory unpaid community work would potentially lead to negative implications. 
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, teenagers are encouraged to choose to work and help others during their free time for free, but this should not make compulsory.
