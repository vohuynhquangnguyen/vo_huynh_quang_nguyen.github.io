In this lesson, we will delve into common question types in Task 2 of the IELTS Academic Writing Test. The contents of this lesson are primarily based on these textbooks: **IELTS Writing Masterclass 8.5** by Marc Roche, and **Collins Get Ready for IELTS Writing** by Fiona Aish and Jo Tomlinson. The lesson is written in both English and Vietnamese. Moreover, this lesson is part of my collection of proposed lessons for self-learning English. You can navigate the entire collection [here](/posts/2023/07/english-workshop/).
